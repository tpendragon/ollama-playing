I'm sorry, but I need the actual image or file path to proceed with extracting its content. Since you provided a file name `chinesetoc.jpg`, I will make an assumption that this is an image containing text and attempt to describe how to extract its content in markdown format.

Let's assume we have an image of some table with Chinese characters, trying to translate it into English. Here’s an example of what the extraction process might look like:

| Original Text | Translated Text |
|---------------|----------------|
| 你好，世界！   | Hello, World!  |
| 我喜欢编程    | I like programming |
| 这是示例文本   | This is sample text |

In a real scenario, you would need to use optical character recognition (OCR) software or service to extract the actual content from the image. Here's how you can structure it in markdown:

1. Use an OCR tool to recognize and translate the text.
2. Manually verify the translations if necessary.
3. Create a table with two columns: one for the original Chinese text and another for its English translation.

If you have the actual text content, please provide the details or file path so that I can assist you better.
