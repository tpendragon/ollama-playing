## LLM Summary of Image

Here's a detailed description of the poster, aimed at someone who is blind:

**Overall Impression:**

The poster has a vintage, slightly distressed aesthetic, like an old political flyer. It's primarily a muted beige/tan color,
with dark lettering and a prominent red floral arrangement.

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Floral Arrangement:** At the center is a cluster of vibrant red roses, but they appear to be in a state of decay. The
petals are wilted, curling at the edges, and some are falling off. There's a lot of foliage—green leaves and stems—intermixed
with the roses, but those leaves are also drooping and appear dry. The roses are positioned a bit off-center.
*   **Text:** There is a lot of text. The top of the poster features text in all capitals, as does the bottom. In the middle
there is a mix of all capitals and cursive.
    *   At the top, the words “ΤΟ ΠΑΣΟΚ ΣΥΝΙΣΤΑ:" are aligned to the left in bold, black, capital letters.
    *   In the middle, the text "ΑΠΟΜΕΤΑΡΡΥΘΜΙΣΗ ΠΑΝΤΟΥ" is in large, bold, black, capital letters. Overlaid on top of this text
in sweeping, red cursive is the word "ΑΠΟ".
    *   At the bottom, in smaller, black, capital letters, is the word "ΟΝΝΕΔ".
*   **Background:** The background is a solid, slightly textured beige/tan color.
*   **Borders:** A dark, rectangular border frames the entire poster.

**Overall Composition:**

The floral arrangement is the most visually striking element, but the text dominates the space. The text and the flower
arrangement are overlapping. The muted background and dark border create a strong contrast, drawing the eye to the center of the
poster.
